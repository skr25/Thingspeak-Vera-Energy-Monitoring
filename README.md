# Thingspeak-Vera-Energy-Monitoring
This project captures watts and Kwatts from Vera for the connected devices and update the Thingspeak charts with all data received. You can see the graphs of enery uses daaily, weekly and monthly and understand the trend.

Vera has Energy Monitoring device which pulishes Watts and Kwh to my local MQTT server. This program reads MQTT published values for KWH and Watts and logs to the Thinkspeak chart using Thingspeak API and Key.
